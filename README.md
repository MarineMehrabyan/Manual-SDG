# Manual-SDG
This repository contains a Python implementation of a simple neural network trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) from scratch. The neural network is built using NumPy and Pandas libraries, providing a foundational understanding of the underlying principles of neural networks and optimization algorithms.
